The Google services.json file and a few potentially sensitive Firebase files were removed to protect my Firebase account, since this GitHub repository will be public and very loosely monitored.

This may cause issues with anyone attempting to run this code, however it can be fixed by attaching your own database:

Baseline database setup, with tasks to be added: 

upgrades
├── U1
│   └── True (default)
└── U2
    └── True (default)


I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. However, since this repository will not be monitored, I didn’t want to risk a potential issue or charges.

Other than that, the Firebase implementation remains unchanged.
